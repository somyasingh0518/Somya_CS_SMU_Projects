How many distinct URLs are here?

<A href="../">../</A>

<a href="../index.htm">../index.htm</a>

<P>
Items 1 and 2 are relative URLs which must be resolved by the browser to an absolute URL.  Item 1 is the same as #4, and #2 is the same as #3.
<P>
Item 4 specifies a directory (i.e. the trailing slash notation).  Does the server permit directory listing?  Is there a default file to return (e.g. index.html)?
<P>
Item 5 appears to specify a file (with no extension).  The server attempts to return the file, but finds it as a directory.
Thus code 303 is generated before converting the "file" to a "directory" and processing it.
